# Community Development at MakerDAO

The Community Development group's mandate is to directly foster the growth of the MakerDAO ecosystem by incentivising our most motivated members. We do this through a series of initiatives designed to create direct incentives and support structures which allow people to participate in, and contribute to, the success the Dai Stablecoin platform.

## The Initiatives

### [Grants Program](grants/)

One of our most important initiatives is the identifying and incentivizing of third-party talent to contribute to the ecosystem. The initial iteration of this granting process is dedicated to bootstrapping projects with small to midsize grants. The allocated funds are only released when teams reach predetermined milestones. Successful projects may also gain access to internal consulting resources.

### [Community Meetups](meetups/)

We believe that community members, like you, are incredibly important to MakerDAO and play a valuable role in building a stronger ecosystem. The Community Development Group wants to provide the resources you need to increase Dai adoption and help us bring stability and financial inclusion to the under-banked. To do this, the we are making available a micro-granting program dedicated to helping community members facilitate meetups in their communities.

### [Governance](governance/)

In bootstrapping Governance, we set up this section to accomodate and hold helpful resources such as transcripts of the meetings, historic summaries, and more. 

### [FAQs](faqs/)

We welcome you to help improve the MakerDAO FAQs by submitting Pull Requests or reaching out to us with feedback.
